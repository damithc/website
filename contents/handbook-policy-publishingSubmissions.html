<div id = 'policy-publishingSubmissions'>
<p>The source code and all other submitted documents may be made publicly available sometime after 
the submission for reuse without any restrictions.Â <br />
Is publishing submissions unfair to the team? We don't think so. We publish your submissions 
only after giving you the credit you deserve for it. Besides, if you were the first to think of 
something your peers are willing to adopt later, that means you are already ahead of them and they 
are unlikely to earn more marks by adopting your ideas.</p>
