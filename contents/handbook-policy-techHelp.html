<div id = 'policy-techHelp'>
<p><span class="highlighted">Do not expect your project tutor to code or debug for you</span>. We 
strongly discourage tutors from giving technical help directly to their own teams because,</p>
<ul>
  <li>we want to train you in troubleshooting tech problems yourselves. Allowing direct tech help 
  from tutors transfers the troubleshooting responsibility to tutors.</li>
  <li>it may not be fair for some teams because some Java teams might be supervised by C++ tutors 
  and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="highlighted">It is ok to ask for help from classmates even for assignments</span>, 
even from other teams, as long as you don't copy from others and submit as your own. It doesn
't matter who is helping you as long as you are learning from it.</p>
<p><span class="highlighted">We encourage you to give tech help to each other</span>, but do it in 
a way that the other person learns from it.</p>
