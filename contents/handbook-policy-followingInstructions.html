<div id = 'policy-followingInstructions'>
<p>When working with others, especially in a large class such as CS2103, Â it is very important 
that you adhere to standards, policies, and instructions imposed on everyone. Not doing so creates 
unnecessary headaches for everyone and sends negative signals about your work attitude. That is 
why we give participation points for following instructions carefully.</p>
